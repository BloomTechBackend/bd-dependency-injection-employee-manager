If the error is related to not being able to find a Dagger class, make sure you have built your project before IntelliJ
can find the Dagger classes. The classes should show up in an `/annotation-generated-src` directory in your project
workspace and IntelliJ, and the folder icon in your IntelliJ project should be blue.
